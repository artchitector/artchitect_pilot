      How <b>God</b> creates a picture with artchitect?
    </p>
    <p>
      First, <b>God</b> conceives the idea of the work, it's meaning, style, colors. This is the original idea of
      artwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, <b>God</b> needs to look into the Stable Diffusion v1.5 mechanism, which draws pictures. (Stable Diffusion
      is a
      generative neural network that can draw pictures from a set of words). God needs to understand which keywords and,
      most importantly, which seed he needs to use so that the work that God expecting appears at the output of neural
      network.
      Since God is omniscient, He knows perfectly well what data he needs to use.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <b>Seed</b> is a prime number, random noise, from which the neural network creates the final work.
      Each seed is unique idea of artwork.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <b>God</b> knows in advance at what time the picture is being created, and he only needs to intervene in the
      operation of
      the system at the moment when the program code will process the creation of this particular picture. In order for
      the program code to act according to the Will of God, the code reads the desired number from a quantum random
      number generator. This number serves as a source for making a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the quantum world is controlled only by <b>God</b>, only <b>God</b> is able to send the necessary quanta of
      light to the
      webcam, the webcam translates these quanta into the form of electrical signals, electrical signals turned
      into numbers, and numbers turned into God-realized keywords and seed for the picture that God is waiting to see on
      <a href="https://artchitect.space">artchitect.space</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>God</b> knows in advance which pictures will be painted anytime, because He creates everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Briefly - <b>God</b> creates artworks.<br/>
      These divine artworks are the cards that you see below. Each with its own story. </p>
