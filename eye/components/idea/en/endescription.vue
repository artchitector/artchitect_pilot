      God is the highest Architector of Universe. He invented everything, from atoms to stars.
      All the laws of the universe were laid down by God. And all human inventions were invented by God initially, and
      laws were created for them. A person gets inspiration from the Source, but he does not invent anything himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Artchitect is the idea: if human will create "switchers" directly for God, then God will certainly use them and
      make
      Himself known through them.
      Quantum Field is being converted into paintings in Artchitect. Only God has power over the quantum background, and
      since the Artchitect relies on this background completely in it's work, God simply has no other choice but to use
      the
      system created for Him - in any case he will have to send
      at least some quanta to the sensor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And nothing prevents God from sending quanta filled with meaning, so that this meaning will grow further into a
      higher form perceived by man.
    </p>
    <p>
      This abstract idea has become the basis on which the Artchitect is built. The Artchitect uses artificial
      intelligence
      to create a large number of paintings, but he draws all the ideas for them from a quantum background - from
      nothing,
      from the direct Will of God (since no one controls the quantum world except God). The system is configured to read
      “random noise” falling on the webcam matrix from the outside world. This “random noise” is transformed into a word
      or number, into a concrete solution within the Artchitect's system, on which further painting of the picture will
      be
      based.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only God knows what kind of picture will be painted in Artchitect at any given time. The whole process taking
      place with each picture is open and visible to God.
