    <p>
      Here you can send request to the Universe and receive answer in the form of your personal card.

      Then he [Jesus] touched their eyes and said, â€œAccording to your faith let it be done to you";<br/>

      Main idea of Artchitect is that it interconnected with Quantize Fields, which controlled directly by Universe
      (more info in <NuxtLink to="/idea">idea section</NuxtLink>).
      Universe/God absolutely knows that exactly You will send this request, and Universe/God can create next card
      specially for You, as answer for you. The idea of the card may not be clear, but you should think about it.
    </p>
    <p>Try it. Maybe the answer is closer than it seems.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p><b>First step</b>: think carefully about you request/pray, that you want to send to the Universe. Concentrate your mind on your request.</p>
    <p><b>Second step</b> (optional): describe your request in the text field. This will help you better understand
      and systematize the common idea of the request. Alternatively, you can write your request on a piece
      of paper or think it over in your head. The universe knows in advance and better than you what you are asking for.
      <br/>
      <b>You keep it brief!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <textarea class="textarea" v-model="pray"
                rows="2"
                :placeholder="`Type your request message. Write carefully. Between you and Universe. Secure - data not being send anywhere.`"></textarea>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Third step</b>: finalize request with "Pray" button. This will erase text from textarea and start card creation process.
      You will see your result when it finished.
    </p>
    <div class="notification">
      <b>Important</b>: nobody will know, what you asked and what you received. Data about request not sends anywhere.
      But your personal card will appear in common list of cards at <NuxtLink to="/">artchitect.space</NuxtLink>.
      There will no any links to your person (no any personal data saved anywhere).
