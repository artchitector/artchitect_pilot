    <p>
      Here you can send request to the Universe and receive answer in the form of your personal card.

      Main idea of Artchitect is that it interconnected with Quantize Fields, which controlled directly by Universe
      (more info in
      <NuxtLink to="/idea">idea section</NuxtLink>
      ).
      Universe/God absolutely knows that exactly You will send this request, and Universe/God can create next card
      specially for You, as answer for you. The idea of the card may not be clear, but you should think about it.
    </p>
    <p>Try it. Maybe the answer is closer than it seems.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p><b>First step</b>: think carefully about you request/pray, that you want to send to the Universe. Concentrate
      your mind on your request.</p>
    <p><b>Second step</b> (optional): describe your request in the text field. This will help you better understand
      and systematize the common idea of the request. Alternatively, you can write your request on a piece
      of paper or think it over in your head. The universe knows in advance and better than you what you are asking for.
      <br/>
      <b>You keep it brief!</b>
    </p>

      <textarea class="textarea"
                rows="2"
                :disabled="loading"
                :placeholder="`Type your request message. Write carefully. Between you and Universe. Secure - data not being send anywhere.`"></textarea>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Third step</b>: finalize request with "Pray" button. This will erase text from textarea and start card creation
      process.
      You will see your result when it finished.
    </p>
    <div class="notification">
      <b>Important</b>: nobody will know, what you asked and what you received. Data about request not sends anywhere.
      But your personal card will appear in common list of cards at
      <NuxtLink to="/">artchitect.space</NuxtLink>
      .
      There will no any links to your person (no any personal data saved anywhere).
