> Artchitect - it is an amazing autonomous creative machine capable of creating magnificent artworks inspired by the
> universe around us. In its continuous creativity , the machine receives inspiration from the natural entropy of the
> universe, represented as background light, and creates unique artworks without human participation.

Techically artchitect-project is the control-system wrapped around an art-system - Stable Diffusion AI v1.5. Stable
Diffusion AI is the ability to draw pictures for Artchitect.
The data to run Architect is light background/noise. The light background is read using a webcam, the frame is converted
to an int64 number. **Int64** is the source of all solutions (randomly select something from the list or create a unique
initial value).
