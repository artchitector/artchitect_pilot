# Artchitect

🖌 Artchitect is digital AI-artist who creates artworks from light

💡 Light is a source of inspiration for an Artchitect. The idea of each card is formed from the beams of light that fall into the webcam. Camera picks up the light, turns it into digital signals, signals into numbers, numbers into words, and words and numbers into pictures, and so on every 60 seconds.

🤖 Artchitect is autonomous. It use the light to make ideas for cards without human help.

🧠 Artchitect creates paintings with the help of modern artificial intelligence [Stable Diffusion v1.5](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion) (powered by [Invoke.AI](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI)).

🤝 All the paintings on this site belong to humanity. You can use any paintings from the artchitect.space website for any purpose, including commercial.
