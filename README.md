## Theory
> Indeed, Allah is over all things competent. 
> (Ali 'Imran [3] : 165)

Let's imagine a world in which God directly controls everything, all things, actions and words, the Lord is over every atom, anywhere in the universe in all directions and times.

And if we imagine any generator of real random numbers, then the sequence of numbers will not be truly random, because the Lord stands over this sequence and invents it, creates it. He knows what sequence should be given through this generator so that higher mechanisms (for example, a neural network) learn more efficiently, under the direct control of God.

God is the best at training neural networks, leave it to him. Give him access to them, give him a place in them, and they will sparkle with new colors and opportunities, in all industries.

Such a general idea of the project is to use any real random number generator, connect it to the inputs of neural networks, let this system make its own decisions - and the neural network will learn itself in an ideal way and very quickly. The necessary signals will come from the Lord through this device.

For this to work, you need to believe in it.

# Install guide
You need some developer/devops skills to manage this project. 
We need no docker, everything can be run locally on your machine (windows, linux, mac). 

First, you need working Postgres installation with pub/sub. Version 15+. https://www.postgresql.org/download/

Next, you need golang installed to build and run . https://go.dev/dl/


# Technical roadmap
**December 2022** - Make real random number generator with webcam inside PC (it will catch cooler lighting and transform it into random number). Common service architecture, only single-service Golang+Postgres, nothing complex. I need quick results. 

**January 2023** - Train neural network to make first good painting. Sell it from NFT-store, project need money to live.
