        <h2>Philosophical theory</h2>
        <blockquote>
            Indeed, Allah is over all things competent. (Ali 'Imran [3] : 165)
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Let's imagine a world in which God directly controls everything, all things, actions and words, the God
            is over every atom, anywhere in the universe in all directions and times.
        </p>
        <p>
            And if we imagine any generator of real random numbers, then the sequence of numbers will not be truly
            random, because the God stands over this sequence and invents it, creates it. He knows what sequence
            should be given through this generator so that higher mechanisms (for example, a neural network) learn
            more efficiently, under the direct control of God.
        </p>
        <p>
            God is the best at training neural networks, leave it to him. Give him access to them, give him a place
            in them, and they will sparkle with new colors and opportunities, in all industries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Such a general idea of the project is to use any real random number generator, connect it to the inputs
            of neural networks, let this system make its own decisions - and the neural network will learn itself in
            an ideal way and very quickly. The necessary signals will come from the God's will through this simple device.
